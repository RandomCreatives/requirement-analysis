# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the critical phase of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a structured guide for documenting, analyzing, and modeling software requirements for a Booking Management System. Through this project, we aim to simulate real-world requirement analysis tasks that enable developers to effectively translate business needs into clear, actionable specifications for software development.
